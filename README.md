# 🦺 Smart Surveillance – PPE Violation Detection System  

## 📌 Overview  
Ensuring worker safety at construction and industrial sites is critical. However, manual monitoring of **Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)** usage (like helmets, safety vests, gloves, etc.) is time-consuming and prone to human error.  

This project introduces an **AI-powered Smart Surveillance System** that uses **YOLOv8** for **real-time PPE violation detection**. The system processes CCTV/live camera feeds or uploaded videos, detects whether workers are wearing required PPE, and sends **instant alerts** to supervisors when violations occur.

## 🚀 Features  
- 🎥 **Video/Live Camera PPE Detection** – Detects helmets and vests in real time.  
- ⚡ **Fast & Accurate** – Built with **YOLOv8** for high FPS object detection.  
- 🔔 **Violation Alerts** – Triggers email/SMS/web alerts for supervisors.  
- 🌍 **API Ready** – FastAPI backend with REST endpoints.  
- 📂 **File Upload** – Upload video files and receive processed outputs with bounding boxes.  
- 🧹 **Auto Cleanup** – Old uploaded files are cleaned automatically.  
- 💻 **Cross-platform** – Can run on **CPU** (slower) or **GPU** (faster).  
- 📊 **Scalable** – Supports multiple cameras/sites.
